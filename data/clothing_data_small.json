CZ has a grading system, just as diamond has theirs. Most CZ jewelry is set with AAA or lesser. These are top line. In appearance, they rival beautiful quality diamonds. Only you will know they aren't diamond. The cut on these stones is ideal. Just beautiful. These earrings have it all; brilliance, fire, sparkle, shine, clear, clean in clarity, and an awesome cut.The setting is solid. Set just like diamond...solid with great looking prongs tips holding the stones in place. The prongs give a slightly squared off look to the \"diamond\". The basket is not bulky. The platinum overly is very well done, most likely won't cause any  allergic reactions. The metal is not the light silvery color photographed.  These are better than any department store CZ studs set in 14k that I've seen. Overwhelmingly, those have lesser stone quality and flimsy settings. This is solid.\"The Platinum Overlay Collection\" by Amazon has beautiful, excellent quality, jewelry. While I recently purchased these, I bought a few pieces from their collection a few of years ago. All of my pieces still look just as beautiful as when I received them. Even with constant wearing, the platinum has never faded. Stones are still beauties.(Now, I don't shower or wash my hair with earrings on, but I did and often ).  The collection is dwindling. Not many pieces are still available. You may want to pick these up. You don't often see CZ this gorgeous.  Your, predisposed to jealousy, co-workers will be so envious...get ready for the \"evil eye\".5mm is about 3/4ct in each ear. I love this size...not too big and not too small. Just perfect, thanks Amazon.UPDATE:  I just ordered a pair for my fav cousin. She's a bit of a diamond snob. Amazon shipped directly to her(I'm excited..couldn't wait for her to get them), but I should've put them in a fancy box, and wrapped up for Christmas.  I could have heard her, \"Oh Trinny, you shouldn't have\". I'd had to tell her, \"Oh Pat, but I didn't\".  Seriously, these earrings have eliminated my desire for  beautiful natural diamonds of this carat weight. I'd have needed to save to purchase them, and still would have had a hard time justifying spending several thousand for a pair of earrings. My money is more wisely saved for more important purchases.

This one is even better than my old one! It has so many pockets for organization which seems rare for across the body bags. Usually, they are just one big pouch with maybe 1 or 2 pockets so it gets full and heavy and takes a month to find anything.I received a beautiful Chanel purse from my future MIL and I've never owned a nice purse like it - I'm not really a name brand obsessed person but it was a gift and I love it! I started to use it for everyday use and I was always freaking out about putting it on the ground and it getting scuffed/dirty/etc. I wanted to use it only for special occasions so in comes the Piazza Day Bag to save the day.Not only are all of my items organized in an OCD fashion without the disorder, but the bag itself is trendy, stylish, and versitile. I purchsed the Sandstone color to go with black or brown and all colors inbetween. It is exactly the color I wanted - the picture makes it seem like a light khaki but in person, it's a little darker which I am more than fine with. Also, the strap can be adjusted to make it an off the shoulder or across the body.I'm in love with beverages so I always have one with me and there is a pouch on the side just for that! I love being hands free and this bag definitely makes that possible.I do have one minor complaint and it is quite superficial. The zipper pulls aren't like the ones in the picture that match the bag. Instead, they are a hanious multi-color of red, grayish blue, and yellow. I don't know if Sandstone is the only one that comes with these, but I know I can always remove them or replace them.Now that I know how awesome these bags are, I could very well be the proud owner of the red Piazza Day Bag one day.", "asin": "B0013KBX7K"}, {"helpful": [0, 0], "overall": 5.0, "reviewerID": "ADS99W8WMEXZ2", "summary": "Comfortable every day shoe", "reviewTime": "01 14, 2014", "unixReviewTime": 1389657600, "reviewerName": "Michelle Dunn \"Author & artist\"", "reviewText": "I absolutely love these shoes,  They were comfortable right out of the box, they look nice, and are easy to wear, just slip them on.

Even at 2 sizes too large. Also, this is very short. The bottom edge of the shirt hits the top of my belt loops and because of the way it is hemmed it tends to slide up often. Also, from the picture, it looks like it is a sweatshirt. While i didn't care either way, It is thinner than a t-shirt. I did opt to keep this instead of sending it back, but it definitely wasn't what i was hoping it to be. I have to wear a tank top underneath to keep from showing my belly/back.

I even asked a friend of mine who has these in the men's version, and he went against what everyone else said, insisting I should size down. I sit somewhere between 7.5 and 8 and after reading a ton of reviews, I noticed that on the Keen website, they suggest sizing up one half size, so I did. Turns out to have been a good decision. The size 8 was a perfect fit, and I'm pretty sure the size 7.5 would have been too snug.I bought these to wear on vacation, and had never worn them before going, other than to see if I ordered the right size. So the first time I put them on, I wore them all day walking around Busch Gardens in Tampa Bay, Florida. No breaking in time. Just put them on and wore them walking all day long. I was quite pleased to find that my feel took to them well and other than the heels feeling a little tender, after 8 hours of walking and standing lines, my feet didn't hurt the next day.I also wore these out into the ocean several days while on vacation. We stayed at a hotel right on the gulf, and walked along the beach every morning. I wore these when we were out for our morning walks, and then wore them several times when I was swimming and walking out chest deep in the ocean, looking for seashells. After being completely submerged in water, I found they took about a day to fully dry out again. These are great multi-purpose shoes. Water or walking, they work great for both. I bought them in the Bluestone/Neutral Grey color and they are perfect when you wear jeans all the time, like myself.

I had not brought anything with me to layer with and I stopped into the outerwear section of a sporting goods store looking for something affordable I could pick up to keep warm for the rest of the day. I found myself deciding between this Columbia Benton Springs Zip Fleece and aNorthFace Osito Jacket for Women. Both were just as warm and nice looking in appearance, but the Columbia was 1/3 the price. So the Columbia is was.Color:I picked it up in a color called \"Corange\". I'm thinking it stands for a cross between coral and orange, since this is how I would describe the color. The \"corange\" color can easily transition from summer to fall.Material:The material is a nice medium weight polar fleece. The zipper is the same color as the jacket so it blends right in. Nice sized pockets which do have zippers of their own as well. It is unlined and it is hood-less in case you are looking for either of these in a jacket. The sleeves do have an elastic inside them, so you can push them up and they will stay put. The bottom has an elastic drawstring cord on the inside in case you want to cinch it to keep cold wind out.Size:It's definitely full in size. I typically wear a size 12 and the large is plenty big. I tried the XL and was swimming in it. Large would probably fit up to a size 14. If your near a size 10, you may want to go with a Medium.

If you are, like me, a large fellow with a body shape not popularized in catalogs or the media, you do not want these pants. They look like skinny jeans on me, and skinny jeans do NOT look good on me. My wife couldn't stop laughing, which was not my desired reaction.The upside? They're stitched well, are super soft, lightweight, and even have pockets!  Yes, pockets, so you can have your phone in your pocket while you walk around the house in comfort. They have a single button on the fly, so they won't gape open in an obscene manner.All that being said, I would NOT leave my apartment in these pants, unless I wanted to end up being arrested for public indecency.edit/update: Alright, I don't know what's going on, but I got a pair of XXL (thinking this might resolve some of the issues I had with my XL pair) and they are ENTIRELY DIFFERENT. Hanes must have redesigned these pants or something, because my new pair didn't pill up with fuzzies all over them, and they were HUGE. I mean, they are like full-on yoga pants. Maybe this is a design distinction between the XL and XXL sizes or something, I don't know, but my XL pair was like leggings, and my XXL pair is like wearing a pair of Andre the Giant's yoga pants. They're longer and the seat/groin/everywhere IS HUGE. Remember Pee Wee's Playhouse, that old show that was on Saturday mornings? When Pee Wee would pay in his giant underpants? Yeah, that's how much bigger my XXL pair were than my XL pair. Anyway, the fabric is nicer, the fit is much more like what I expect from \"lounge\" pants or \"sleep\" pants. In short, they made a vast improvement, and my guess is that all the sizing and fit stuff changed from one incarnation of these pants to the next.I'd post before/after photos, but again -- I don't want to be jailed for public indecency.", "asin": "B001KVQM96"}, {"helpful": [1, 1], "overall": 5.0, "reviewerID": "A2PMZWJM5CE2AM", "summary": "fifi", "reviewTime": "01 30, 2013", "unixReviewTime": 1359504000, "reviewerName": "M.

The quality of the last model number I'd worn regularly, however, dipped so low that I had to stop buying them (I know some people like paper-thin jeans, but I wear jeans for the reasons they were created, and so I have no use for a paper-thin jean.)At first, I looked around at some alternative brands. While I did find some I liked better then the Levi's I'd been wearing, I didn't find any that satisfied me. After noticing how the 501 STF's seemed heavier, I decided to give them a try for the first time in years.In the beginning, I loved the new fit and the starched denim, all while hoping that the material would remain firm after losing the starch. Unfortunately, the material was not much different then the ultra-thin pre-wash 501's, after a few washes.I also want to note that the seams were ridiculously crooked on some, including one pair where the seam twisted 45 degrees until it was completely in the front. Having been a big fan of Levi's Americana for my entire life, I'm very disappointed in what's become of the brand lately.update: It's time I update this review, so here goes.Since my initial review, I think the Levi Strauss & Co. has rebounded some and is on the way up. I now own many pairs of Levi's that I like, including about a dozen different colors of the 501 STF. I've seen some improvement in the problems listed above, but most of the improvement has centered on updated styling with both old and new models.I'm still disappointed with the diminishing quality of the old models, but they do seem better then they did just a few years back. I'm also disappointed with the rising prices, but I'll continue to buy Levi's until the sale prices I now pay are unjustifiable. I still find many good reasons to criticize Levi's products, also, but I like how the company seems more focused on today's styles, rather then styles of the past, as they have been doing for decades.My reason for updating this review is because I recently purchased the indigo-navy jeans found here (style #005011404), because they were on sale. They look nice, but they're awfully close to the light-blue rigid I already own, so I'm not sure if I'll keep them.Speaking of style numbers, why can't retailers list these so customers know what they're purchasing? Not only do most retailers not do this, but some even change the color name to something else. Levi's should put the color name on the tag, so people can see it in the pictures and while looking at them in stores.Update 2:  I've been wearing these, again, for several years now and mostly love them.  My only problem is that the butt is too large and I agree with others who say that it used to be smaller.  This causes them to sag in the butt on me, which I really don't like.  I think they're now making them so they fit men who really should be wearing relaxed jeans and this is probably why they're so often incorrectly labeled as having a relaxed fit.Update 3:  A while back, I purchased a pair to wear without washing and they fit great.  I don't know how they'll end up after washing, because I sized down in the waist to a size I never and the inseam is my normal length.  Then I purchased another pair with the same waist size, but longer inseam, just to see how they'd fit after soaking.  I'll update this when I do, but just want to say that the only difference with the other pair is that they're 2\" longer in the inseam, but despite having the same waist size, they seem MUCH larger in the waist.  So much larger that they're baggy on me, while the others are not, and both are 100% cotton.  Levi's are just odd like that sometimes.", "asin": "B0006LJLMG"}, {"helpful": [0, 0], "overall": 3.0, "reviewerID": "A32NZK5H2NIM13", "summary": "Too clingy", "reviewTime": "12 11, 2013", "unixReviewTime": 1386720000, "reviewerName": "Danielle", "reviewText": "I normally wear a size 4 or 6 in pants but a large in this skirt was pretty much skin tight.

No digging in, no pinching, tugging, riding up, etc. It has some good support (not great) and is perfect for wearing around the house when you want support but don't mind a little droop.When you first put it on, things can be perky and well supported. As the day goes on, they do sag a bit more. So underneath a tighter top or blouse it is not the best support. For wearing while sitting at my desk or doing things around the house, it is terrific.I have also snuck out on some errands wearing them and not been bothered at all.They come in a huge variety of colors and a small array of sizes.

It's soft and doesn't pinch or bind when walking or in the saddle and that is a huge plus over several other brands out there.If you are a truly large bust size (DD and E cups or larger, we know who we are) then this bra will in fact be helpful in a number of ways when you're exercising. It does minimize the bounce and subsequent soreness later. It does offer some stability on the front side if you are a rider and fight that tendency to \"tip\" forward in the saddle. The straps did not drift around nor did they pinch or dig into my shoulder either while tacking up my horses.There are two reasons that I am giving this bra only four stars instead of five.1. It's hard to do up by yourself. The hooks in the back are small and difficult to attach without eyes in the back of your head or a second person. Doing the old hook it up in front and twist it around to the back and pull it up thing you do with a regular bra just doesn't work well with this one. Front closures would make this bra one I would consider buying multiples of in every color.2. My husband's first comment upon seeing me in this sport bra was \"You now have a uni-boob\".So... the trade off is good support, no pinching or binding or excessive bouncing while you ride, but your once lovely bosum is now a uni-boob. Thus the four stars.*******************UPDATED REVIEW July 4th 2009 **********************After wearing this bra 3 days in a row in 104 degree temperatures during a horse show and washing it out at night in the hotel room, I am amending my intial review and taking back 1 star! Here's the problem.... The bra began to fray in two places by the end of the second day. The first spot is along the rib band in the back and the frayed area is about the size of a quarter and by the end of the 3rd day it was almost all the way through the band. This is just really poor quality materials - it cannot stand up to friction and wear against the body for 3 consecutive days. It has frayed on the INSIDE of the band against the skin. The second frayed area is on the inside on the front of the left cup. The wear is not along seam either, that I could accept as being a fluke or just a weak spot.Additionally the two frayed areas began to rub on day 3 and were starting to cause red irritated spots against my skin, so I had to ditch the Moving Comfort Fiona Bra all together and go back to the old Enell standby that is 4 years old. I will not be purchasing any other Moving Comfort products again - in the future I will pay the $60 for the high quality Enell bras.", "asin": "B001AOZVSQ"}, {"helpful": [0, 0], "overall": 5.0, "reviewerID": "A3DTZTXDHK08EF", "summary": ":) like!", "reviewTime": "10 3, 2013", "unixReviewTime": 1380758400, "reviewerName": "Natalie", "reviewText": "Buy this!

These are handy to have.The zippered case that is included with many other combo kits makes a handy organizer, as these small items can easily get lost otherwise.This one is JUST THE TOOLS, NO CASE. At the right price this one is still worth having, but you'll want to put the tools in something to keep them together (too many sharp points for a ziplock bag) so if you can find a competing vendor who includes a case for just a few bucks more, I think it's worth it. That's why I give this 4 stars instead of 5.None of these budget kits are what a professional watch repairer who works on high-end watches would probably choose to repair Rolex's and other high end timepieces. At this price, the steel and fit and finish overall are not 'jeweler's quality'.But for home use to change your own watch batteries or re-size links, swap watch bands, take the back off etc this kit will do just fine, and you'll be about as well set up or slightly better than the watch-servicing department at the average retail department store.By all means get one of these kits if you'd like to do routine service on your watch(es) at home.

I delayed to order this for a couple years and finally decided to try it. I got it in black/XL even though the size charts say to get a M and go by bust size, I just know better now. I just knew it would be clingy & I dislike clingy jersey materials because they only make a person look thicker. Although I like the top it is definitely not what I've grown to love about Patty. Its not the usual silky jersey material and its still not a sweater. Its definitely a jersey top thats slightly more abrasive and not as smooth on the skin-I LOVE the material on the off the shoulder kimono top-I own 6 of those alone-(FYI:highly recommend you try those!)  It isnt scratchy by any means, just feels like a cheaper fabric with a looser knit. FIT: it seems proportioned to fit many body types and if you are tall, have a small waist and flat midsection I bet it highlights that quite well. Personally, I am short, I am not over weight but Im more straight figured. It doesn't do anything amazing for me yet it doesn't look bad. Its just not a WOW shirt if that makes sense. The sleeves are extremely long, but from the reviews over the years I see people appreciate that-for us petite people it gets old having shirts made like this & having 6\" of extra fabric to roll/scrunch up. I like that its longer/ covers my rear, can be worn with leggings easily or skinny jeans.  All in all, its a nice unique top-Im curious about trying a color. I just feel its slightly missing the mark in fabric, and the waist is too snug-I'd have preferred a little more width to the waist-while the shoulders are extremely wide on me. This could clearly be because I ordered a much larger size in terms of big shoulder size; however, had I ordered according to the size chart it would be WAY too small in the waist. Since Im short -5'2\"-where the \"waist\" of most Patty tops falls hits my hips area so thats why I order up. Id recommend the top, I'd just caution it's clingy and if you have a mid section it will hightlight that from behind especially with the ruching-it isnt going to do many favors I dont care what people think its doing for them extra fabric may be bothersome and add bulk especially if petite or have a roll or two.

The center stone is about 6mm or 1cttw., and the side stones are 5mm or 3/4cttw each. The band is quite thin, about a 1/16 of an inch. It's little too narrow to give a good balanced look to the size of the stones. Narrower than photographed.  The gram weight on the metal is 1.7 grams. A nicely weighted band would be about 3 grams.  The metal looks like highly polished silver. It doesn't appear to have a finish and may eventually need a good polish.The stones are quite pretty and sparkling, but they do not look like diamond. Two of diamond's main visual characteristics  are shooting fire and brilliance. These don't have depth of fire, but they do sparkle like crazy.  To me, they don't even look like CZ. They certainly are not top graded, AAAAA CZ.  Those stones do rival diamond's appearance.  This ring appears like the Swarovski Crystal stud earrings I own.  For the 13 bucks I paid, I have no complaints.  I'm not returning and will definitely wear. It's not my favorite, but I like this ring okay.This ring didn't need to look like diamond for me to like. The reasons I didn't like better has nothing to do with the stone's quality.  I would have really liked if the silver was heavier weight, the band were thicker, the side stones were 1/2cttw each, and if the silver had a rich plating.For anyone wanting a diamond look in CZ, I recommend the Amazon.Com Collection of Platinum Plated CZ Rings.

Its boxy and lightweight, which makes it very comfortable for a really hot climate. (Hint: it likely will look & fit EXACTLY like it appears in their picture!) Its also somewhat sheer, so I plan to wear a thin tank top with a coordinating color underneath (or one could wear a coordinating bra, or coordinating bathing suit top).  Overall: Its very pretty; the colors and embroidery.  I would also say its cut on the large size.  I bought a size UP and then returned mine for my usual size.Lastly: I love so many of the Sakkas brand cotton/rayon blend tops & dresses because I appreciate them for what they are.  They are intricately embroidered and detailed,  very inexpensive, and usually provide an exceptional great fit/drape. They are also fragile items (colors will bleed when washed even in cold water, items will need gentle care in washing, etc.)- but I'm OK with that because of the great look, fit, and price.  I have MANY Sakkas items.  And as far as this company goes...they are GREAT with fast shipping, returns, etc.!1/15/13 update: I returned the first blouse I got because it was too big (I mistakenly ordered UP one size, which I tend to do with very inexpensive clothing), the newest one (down one size) arrived and was perfect.  I just want to mention that the newest one I got was shorter and I liked it better (I thought the first one was cut too long).  So it really is a gamble as to whether you will get one cut all the way to mid thigh, or cut to hit mid hip.

Surprisingly enough, however, these slippers remain relatively comfortable anyway; they are actually a huge improvement over some rather inexpensive and poorly made slippers I had been wearing.Another thing that I really like about these slippers is the very sturdy sole; the soles of these slippers are very well constructed. I can tell I won't trip and fall too easily when walking around my home.Overall, in this price range these are some of the best slippers for guys.

The color/wash I purchased was called \"Aged Perfect\", which looked like an indigo jean worn for about a year in the pictures. The actual color/wash was close this time, but it looked more contrived then in the pictures. This is fairly typical and it wasn't that far off, this time, but it would have been better if it didn't look like someone had accidentally left a belt sander on them.Another reason I purchased them was because this particular color/wash offered a heavy fabric weight of 12.5 ounces, which doesn't compare to Levi's of the past, but is heavier then many offered today. This is the same fabric weight offered for most shrink-to-fit models, but even though I knew it would seem less heavy due to all the distressing and washing, I'm still amazed by how much lighter they seem compared to my STF's, even after my STF's are well worn and have no starch left in them. And yet, they're still heavier then most colors/washes of pre-washed 501's, and better too, in my opinion.The fit is quite good, although they seem a little roomier then in the past. Unfortunately, I'm so used to buying my STF size that I forgot the sizing is different with pre-washed 501's. This isn't a problem for the waist, but unlike washed STF's, the inseam is about 2\" too long. This isn't a huge deal, because I like the idea of having them tailored to fit better, anyway.Overall, I'm mostly pleased with them, but I still prefer STF's and probably won't be buying another pair of these anytime soon.", "asin": "B0000C321X"}, {"helpful": [0, 0], "overall": 5.0, "reviewerID": "AENH50GW3OKDA", "summary": "Allegrs K Womens Scoop Neck Long Sleeve Bar Striped Hem Tunic Shirt", "reviewTime": "10 10, 2013", "unixReviewTime": 1381363200, "reviewerName": "K", "reviewText": "This Tunic shirt looks just like the picture .Very roomy believe this is true to size even after washing this and placing it in dryer on highest setting it didn't shrink.

The red of the pattern does appear in other places on the right boot.  Still I think more effort should have been made to make the left and right boot match as much as possible.

Fortunately, cleaning is easy in a bucket of soapy water with a plastic bristled brush.  Kids can put these on and take them off easily because of the elastic cord design.  We have continued to purchase KEENs for our oldest as she has grown and passed the old ones down to her younger sister.

Moreover, the back inside of the shirt has no tag that could feel scratchy on the lower part of your neck. The information that used to be on the tag is now imprinted onto the rear inside of the shirt.In addition, the strong neckband makes the garment last longer then ever! The shirts even come five to a pack for added value--great!Just a few extra words of advice based on my experience: I would wash these before wearing them. Sometimes the shirts come out of the plastic bag package with a very, very slight funky smell that must occur because they were packed the way they were. They may also shrink a little during their first wash, so keep that in mind if you want a rather loose fitting T shirt--you may want to order one size up. In addition, check both the sizing chart above on the webpage and the \"pricing and availability\" chart to make sure that you choose the right size for you. I would also wash these T shirts with similar colors to minimize the chances of any colors bleeding onto these T shirts during the wash cycle. If you dry these shirts in a clothes dryer, set the dryer on \"low\" temperature.Overall, these long lasting T shirts by Fruit of the Loom make for great underwear; they could be worn outside but their real purpose is underwear for gentlemen.

Sherwin", "reviewText": "Amazon notes that these socks are \"only made from the finest yarns.\" They mean it, too! These socks keep your feet warm; and they are very well made and last forever. I especially like the way that they are reinforced at the heel and toe for lots and lots of wear. These athletic crew socks can be worn for athletic activities but of course they could be worn for everyday routine use as well. In addition, they are mostly made of cotton but Gold Toe adds stretch nylon and a little bit of spandex. Oh sure, these socks may cost a bit more--but you get so much use out of them that these socks inevitably pay for themselves.These crew length socks also fit any shoe size between 7 and 12; therefore it is--almost--one size fits all. These socks also come in a \"king size\" which fits shoe sizes 12 to 16 for the big and tall customer.  Excellent! The sock itself comes in white or black; but the toe area is literally made from gold colored fibers.I would not dry these socks at high temperatures. This could result in the sock becoming too loose on your foot. Eventually they will \"bunch up\" when you wear them and that's very uncomfortable. Dry these fine socks at a lower temperature. Then they will remain just as comfortable as ever. I know mine do!Overall, you can't go wrong buying these socks. They keep your feet extra warm during colder weather. Moreover, there is a king size for the big and tall customer as well; that size is harder to find these days. They are manufactured so well that you definitely get your money's worth.

I would add another group of people for which these are ideal: lazy fat guys. There are a lot of times when I'm going out to walk the dog or go to the grocery store, but I wear sub-optimal shoes to do those things (i.e., flip-flops). This leads to foot pain, clumsiness, and a general ugliness of the foot (no one should have to see my feet). Lock laces to the rescue!Now, you're not going to get as snug of a fit as you did with traditional laces. That's not the point of lock laces -- they don't replace your old laces in every sense. You trade stability and snugness for convenience and comfort. You'll notice this if you're walking laterally along a hillside, or if you're running and try to change directions suddenly. Your foot will just slide around more inside your shoe and you won't have the stable base that you're used to. On the other hand, you can slip your shoes on really easily without damaging the structure of the back/heel of them, and if your feet swell at all due to heat or fatigue, you'll have a little room in there for them to stretch out.So if you're looking to put these on your running shoes to reduce change-over time in your ironman race, I suggest instead just practicing putting your shoes on very quickly. You won't have the stability and support that you're used to with normal laces.", "asin": "B007DLVLAW"}, {"helpful": [0, 0], "overall": 5.0, "reviewerID": "A2WKQA0L2E9W2U", "summary": "TEVA WOMENS MANDALYN SANDAL BLACK", "reviewTime": "11 15, 2013", "unixReviewTime": 1384473600, "reviewerName": "SPENDERELLA", "reviewText": "WELL IT WAS WORN MOST OF THE SUMMER WITH ALL MY DRESSES AND I WALKED ALOT IN THEM REALLY CAME IN HANDY LEFT THEM IN THE CAR AND PUT THEM ON KIND OF SANDAL SO EVERYONE NEEDS AT LEAST ONE PAIR", "asin": "B0055X3GG2"}, {"helpful": [0, 1], "overall": 5.0, "reviewerID": "A2J4XMWKR8PPD0", "summary": "Great Blend of Jeans and Leggings", "reviewTime": "03 4, 2013", "unixReviewTime": 1362355200, "reviewerName": "Someone54", "reviewText": "I really like this combination of jeans and leggings.

I have tried on a dozen bras, mostly back-closure because front-close bras in my size (36G (US)) apparently don't exist... none fitting as nicely as this one.  It provides excellent shaping and support, lifts/separating beautifully and keeps the girls in place without requiring constant adjustment (this is sort of a plunge style, rather than full-coverage, so I expected some adjusting required).  There is a plastic friction strip sewn into the upper hem that assists in keeping the girls exactly how you positioned them initially, and surprisingly, it works really well without the wearer being able to feel it.  The satiny material is extremely soft and comfortable, and very nice construction for the price.  I have worn it for a week straight without taking it off (at 36G I have to wear a bra to sleep.... you smaller chested ladies out there, count your blessings!) and it hardly caused any indentations at all, which in my experience is miraculous.  The padded shoulder straps are about 3/4\" wide and are very, very comfortable without being bulky.  The band is nice and wide to minimize back roll appearance, a huge bonus.  I must say I was apprehensive about buying a front-closure bra in 36G because the physics doesn't warrant optimism, but frankly the construction of the bra overall along with the sturdy clasp mechanism seems like it should hold up.Two things to note about the fit of the band here:  front closure bands are not adjustable, and I wear a 36 band on the closest hook set (a little bigger than the farthest setting on a 34 band) and this particular band in a 36G fit me perfectly.I will update after a few months of wear on the durability.Update:  I bought 2 of these and at 6 weeks of almost daily use, the white one's clasp broke.  The red one is still going strong at 9 weeks.  Just be gentle with the clasp and make sure you are wearing the correct band size - I think my advancing pregnancy (i.e., expanding ribcage) combined with rough handling trying to adjust it while wearing (again, due to expanding boobs and ribcage... pregnancy sucks) was too much for the clasp, but most people won't have this issue.  I would still recommend this bra, just with the caveat to be gentle with the clasp.

They're too thick or they're in the wrong places or something. I've never had side wires before. As in, structucal wires on the side of the bra, besides the underwires. Seriously. Those side wires are obviously uncomfortable. But even the bra cup underwires are uncomfortable - they go up too high or something. They ride up and hurt me in between my &#34;girls&#34;.Additionally, the sizing is off for this bra. I am normally a size 32&#34; in strapless bras and a size 34&#34; in strapped bras (I normally like my strapless bras a bit on the snug side to make sure everything stays up). I bought a size 34&#34; in this bra, and even that was too snug. I'm on the largest hooks and I'm so thankful when I can come home and take this horrible thing off and put on one of my other bras.I had hoped that this bra would be an ideal solution to my desire to wear halter tops and strapless dresses in the summer.

He's usually in a pair of ultra-thick heavy wool socks once colder weather comes.No need for the wooly Sasquatch socks anymore, though.  These sheepskin slippers are just the ticket for icy feet.  The slip-on style is easy to slide feet into and the soft shearling fleece interior offers incredible warmth.  The outer surface of the slippers is a thick suede which is so far very durable against scuffs.The cushioned memory foam insole is an added bonus for my husband.  A daily long distance runner, he often suffers from tired and sore feet...so the cushioning offers some extra pampering.  There's much to like about these slippers.  But the best thing about them is how comfortable they are.The soles of the slippers offer traction against slipping and are durable and sturdy enough for the occasional traipse outside with our dogs.As other reviewers suggested, I ordered them a half size larger...and they fit perfectly.I do have one small gripe about the pair I received.  I ordered them in the darker Root Beer color; and on the forefoot of one of the slippers, some of the adhesive used to adhere the sole was smeared over the surface of a small inch-square area of the suede.

I initially got it for a hospital stay when I couldn't pull anything over my head or arms- the straps detach from the front with adjustable velcro (which stays put very well!) and there is a closure in back making it easy to get on and off someone who can't move much or has a lot of tubes attached.I now use the bra for working out or sleeping in. As someone with a large bust I feel much more secure and comfortable wearing a bra at almost all times, and this is comfortable enough to sleep in. No underwire to worry about which helps with fit and comfort, but it has good support for my DD bust. It has a lining but no extra padding or foam. I also love that this is a heavy duty sports bra without the common racer-back, which cause problems for me. I got the nude \"Bronte\" color and it works very well under white t-shirts. And it's an unbeatable price here.THE BAD: The band at the bottom, although it's soft heavy elastic, curls up. Almost immediately and evermore after. What a huge let down. Why do sports bras always do this? If the outer fabric is tighter or less stretchy than the lining it would result in the band curling up. I think that is the case with this bra. I'm wracking my brain for a way to fix it. I bought the bra in two sizes but kept both. They both curl up- even the one that is a little looser in the boob.One other small thing: my shoulders are really wide so the straps pull at their little \"button holes\" in the front at a weird angle and it may shorten the life of the bra.", "asin": "B001AOZVSQ"}, {"helpful": [1, 1], "overall": 5.0, "reviewerID": "AJHL7N62ROBOQ", "summary": "GREAT!", "reviewTime": "01 27, 2014", "unixReviewTime": 1390780800, "reviewerName": "Jamielee", "reviewText": "I love these!

I bought this rain jacket for my husband earlier year. This summer we went to Quebec for a week. We took this jacket for my husband and I took a competitor's rain jacket that I've had for a year or so. Both jackets were advertised as \"watertight,\" but my jacket was in the $175-200 range. We had previously noticed while using the jackets as windbreakers that his jacket seemed to \"breathe\" more than mine. I would get a clammy feeling as if skin respiration was getting trapped inside...almost like you would get with a cheap vinyl raincoat...but my husband's Columbia jacket worked great. The big test though was during a day of whale watching. The weather was drizzly when the boat left dock and turned into a pretty steady downpour over the next few hours. While the boat offered an enclosed, heated section, the whales were in abundance and variety so we stayed out by the boat railing in the rain. When we were returned to our hotel later that evening, I was surprised to see that my husband's clothing was completely dry under his jacket. I, on the other hand, was completely soaked through (and cold). I would have expected the opposite since the Columbia jacket was more breathable.Thanks to comments made by some of the other reviewers, I did order the jacket in a size smaller than my husband normally wears.

Your reviews were very helpful in guiding me to select the appropriate size of this waist cincher. It is definitely sturdier than similar products I own. I like that there are two rows of eyes in which to affix the hooks. Right now, I am using the looser setting, but it is nice to know that the item will continue to fit once I lose 10-15 pounds, too. As advertised, this cincher narrows the waist and creates a more-hourglass shape. I find the item to be very comfortable - I can bend over repeatedly yet this stays in place and the bottom doesn't flip up, the way it does with other shapewear. The item is made of a rubbery material, which is probably why it is so flexible and strong. This has a downside: although I don't notice that I am perspiring when I am wearing the item, when I take it off, my skin is definitely clammy.The more significant limitation is something that could cause a wearer of this item great embarrassment. I discovered that this is not a good item to wear when exerting oneself - not because it is difficult to move in (quite the contrary), but because when the rubber heats up against the skin, it gives off a horrid burned rubber smell that others notice. I really wish I had anticipated that problem.

I really like the colors of those two -- the black is actually BLACK and does not seem like it will wash out.  Night Out is a nice, dark blue with contrast stitching. I also appreciate the mid-rise-ish rise as it does not give me a muffin top, but it is not too high.  The only problem I had is the newer pairs are a little too small (not sure if they changed the sizing over the last year or if the ones I have stretched a bit).  I've exchanged one pair for the next larger size, and am keeping the other since I've been losing weight and will fit into the smaller size soon. They are very fitting, with small ankle openings unlike some \"skinny jeans\" that turn out to be more like straight fit jeans. These leggings are quality denim, not thin material, and they hold their shape very well.

I usually wear shoes between a 7.5 and 8, typically leaning more towards 7.5. However I took everyone's suggestion and went a half size up. I'm glad I did, because the size 8 was perfect. I loved my Keen H2's, and wore them the entire time my family and I were on our Disney/Busch Gardens/Beach vacation. They were comfortable the whole time.Fast forward to last week, now I was buying things for kids to wear for a week at summer camp. I thought they would each love a pair of Keens, since they were great for everything from hiking to water sports. I bought my son a pair of H2's, but for my daughter, I bought these keen Whisper shoes. After getting them she tried them on and wasn't sure about the open fit (she wears the same size 8 I do). The Whisper style is a little more open and sandal like, where as the H2's have a more of a closed shoe feel to them. So I brought up my H2's and let her try them on. She likes the more closed-shoe feeling of the H2's, and wanted them, leaving me with her Whispers.I have to say, I am glad she did. I LOVE the Whisper style. They are a just a tiny bit less bulky in appearance, and have a little more feminine shape to them. I like them so much, I want at least one more pair in another color. I have these in the Bluestone color, which is the perfect denim blue jean color.So if you're trying to decide between the Whisper and the H2, the H2 is a little more closed-shoe like, with a bit of a running shoe shape to them. The Whisper is more open and sandal like, having a little less bulk to their shape and designed more like a walking shoe. Both are equal in comfort, just different in shape. Both size 8's felt the same. If you're between a 7.5 and 8, go with the size 8.", "asin": "B001Q5QLP6"}, {"helpful": [1, 1], "overall": 5.0, "reviewerID": "A1SDVXIMK0HL6A", "summary": "BRIGHT Blue", "reviewTime": "06 26, 2014", "unixReviewTime": 1403740800, "reviewerName": "Kyle", "reviewText": "These are great tights.

Patty has some tops which are more questionable in terms of fabrication and being as well made as this one!!!I can find absolutely nothing wrong with this beautiful PattyB.  I just want women to know THEY DON'T NEED TO WORRY ONE LITTLE BIT when ordering this one. I know I sweat ordering some of Patty's tops- simply not sure about the quality and fit.  This top I'll soon have ordered in every color available.  This is certainly one that IS worth the price.  I can't say that about all PB tops.Now.. here's my original review.  I just wanted women to know this is truly a no-brainer.  You'll love it and want to keep it- and possibly order more for your sisters and girl friends. It has a consistent fit in all colors.______________________________________________________________This one in size small fits perfectly.  I'm 5' 6\" tall, around 120 lbs and long torso.  This top is cute and fits like a dream.  I started with the chocolate, came back for gray (haven't received) and lastly ordered in black (just received but haven't tried on and praying it fits like the brown).Don't hesitate on this adorable top.  It looks just like the photo on the bod.  It's my fav and soon I'll own 3 if the other 2 fit like the chocolate.

Moreover, these jeans are a good choice for people like me who are slightly overweight. They really do give you extra room in the thigh and the seat; and that's great!The denim is nice and thick; and these jeans are extremely durable. The excellent stitching helps make this possible. In fact, these jeans can last for years at a time without any fraying--even at the bottoms of the legs. They are made from cotton and they are permanent press. However, I would wash these jeans with similar colors to avoid any color dye bleeding onto white garments in the wash or dryer cycle. They say that you should tumble dry these on low; but I use the permanent press settings on my dryer and that seems to work fine without any problems. They come in five colors, too. Black jeans are even possible in an office where you don't have to dress too fancy but yet blue jeans just won't be allowed, either.Overall, these fine jeans by Wrangler easily rival any jeans made by other manufacturers. Make sure you choose the right size and color for you if you're using the pricing and availability chart above on this webpage. If you want a pair of loose fitting yet rugged, durable jeans, this may be just what you're looking for.

Two pairs that I received were authentic and one pair were fake.  The fake Ugg's had the holographic tag, came in a box with a holographic sticker, and with packing and materials identical to the authentic Ugg's -- the only way I was able to tell the fakes were that they absolutely REEKED.  The boot itself smelled fine, like sheepskin, but the soles smelled VERY strongly of new plastic or chemicals. I could smell it before I'd even pulled them out of the box.  Real Ugg's do not have this smell.  Go to any fine department store and smell for yourself. If you receive Ugg's and the soles smell strongly of paint/chemicals/plastic... return them, they are not authentic.  If you are familiar with those foam rubber jigsaw puzzle pads they make for babies... it's that kind of smell.At the time I purchased the boots, Amazon was not an authorized seller of Uggs (apparently they now are), however a number of the marketplace sellers on the site are.  If you visit Ugg's website, you can find a list of authorized sellers.  Unfortunately, as I discovered, several sellers on Amazon are using names very similar to authorized vendors but are not actually that vendor.  So be careful.  Some of these folks selling the fakes are still charging $180 for the classic tall.  You will not find authentic Ugg's on sale, reduced, or anything like that at any authorized site.  If you want real Ugg's be prepared to pay full price for them or end up with fakes.The AUTHENTIC Ugg's I received were both from Shoe Central out of Ashland, Oregon -- they ARE an authorized dealer.

I'm a size 8 and I could easily wear them as a pair of pants (as opposed to just leggings).- Ridiculously comfortable.  The inner lining feels *wonderful.*  I cannot overstate this - they feel heavenly.- Not too long.  I'm 5'3\" and they're is only the tiniest bit of fabric bunching around my ankles.  Worth noting though is that they're very stretchy and would probably fit just as well on someone a good deal taller than me.- Warm.  This is the whole reason I got them, and they've not disappointed. They wouldn't be enough for seriously cold weather, but if you're just walking around a chilly house, these'll do the trick.- Sexy.  I mean, they're essentially yoga pants.  Of course they're sexy.Cons:- As a general \"hey, this doesn't matter to me, but it might matter to you,\" the crotch on these pants is very low.  Again, I'm kind of short, so it's not noticeable, but taller women might want to reconsider.  Of course, everyone should reconsider buying these because...- The other reviews are not kidding about the smell.  I read them and thought, \"eh, I'll just soak them.\"  No.  No, you cannot just soak them.  These pants smell so strongly of chemicals that I had to leave work to go change.  It is incredibly overpowering and will saturate a small space in minutes.  Imagine cleaning your bathroom and not opening a window or turning on a vent, because it's exactly like that.  Literally nauseating and it doesn't go away.- I'd also read that these pants pill easily after washing, which - again - I dismissed as something easily solvable:  I'd just hand wash them.  Unfortunately, that didn't stop them from pilling.  Oh, they were fine after I finished laundering them, but they pill pretty much when they come into contact with anything.  It'd be one thing if they pilled where my thighs touched at the top, but they're pilling at the backs of my thighs where I sit on my feet.I would love - LOVE - to love these pants.

In addition, although these jeans are essentially permanent press, I would wash these jeans with similar colors to avoid any color dye bleeding onto white garments in the wash or dryer cycle.If you want a pair of jeans with some extra room in the seat and thigh areas but yet come with a straight leg, this is exactly what you're looking for.

These Crocs Cayman sandals are extremely comfortable with their trademark loose fit; and they are so lightweight I could practically swear I'm not wearing anything on my feet! In addition, these sandals are great for both the gents and the ladies.They are quite loose and comfortable; and the sole is almost completely ribbed to lessen the chance that I could fall while wearing them. Although the soles of these Crocs are advertised to be \"slip-resistant;\" I would caution against running while wearing crocs anyway. You could trip and fall because Crocs are oversized; they are made this way for the sake of comfort.The footbed practically cradles my feet and these sandals are especially good for people who are always running around doing informal activities. They feel great regardless if you are walking around the big city, hanging out with friends, or just wearing them as a type of slipper inside the house. Excellent!These crocs also feature an adjustable rear heel strap; this can be pushed forward so that the crocs are more like clogs. Moreover, these sandals are made from a very strong form of rubber-like resin--which takes abuse like I never imagined it could. Crocs are intentionally manufactured to be extra wide and a bit extra long for comfort. That's great designing for you!One caveat: don't forget to check the \"pricing and availability chart\" before you order your pair of sandals.

The main thing I want to concentrate on is the sizing.  I wear size 11D in most shoes, but often go with a 10.5D in Merrell's.  However, the Waterproof Moab was so small that I went with a 11.5D, which fells big, but I wear them with heavy socks.  The 11D just seemed to small.With the Ventilator, the 11D seems slightly larger, though.  It's still a little small on me, but not so much that I think I need to size up.  My toes do touch sometimes, but the toe box is generous and they're not uncomfortable.  Unfortunately, neither size seems to fit me great, so I had to choose and the 11.5D just seemed far too large with the Ventilator.For the record, I don't think my feet could fall in between sizes more then they do with this shoe, and I don't know why it happens, because they're very spacious.  Overall, it's a great shoe and I really love it, but just wish the sizing was better for me.Update: Well, several months later and I wish I had gone with the larger size.  The 11's still feel big enough with the uppers, but unlike the larger Moab waterproof version, they strain my legs after wearing them for a while.  I'm not sure if my foot is just a little too big for the footbed or if the sole is different with the Ventilator, because unlike the waterproof version, the same? Vibram soles make a lot of noise while I walk,  and just feel hard and cheap.  The waterproof Moab's feel great, but the Ventilator was killing my ankles.  Strangely enough, my feet are fine and it's just my ankles/legs that hurt, but again, I don't have any of these problems with the Moab waterproof shoe.I also find the Ventilator very hot.

I have worn BearPaw, EMU and other popular competitors and without a doubt Uggs is definitely the way to go. The popular competitors seem to over do it with either the boots are too heavy on the feet or they don't given enough support.If you are looking to keep the feetsie's warm, want comfort and something you can wear with anything these are the boots you want.

I found this on Amazon by chance, decided to try it, and I'm sooo glad I did!I received the bra about noon, wore it in Zumba class in the afternoon, and ordered my second one in the evening. I couldn't believe my senses the first time I put it on: it provides great support, reduces the bounce to a minimum, and doesn't 'squash' the breasts. It actually looks good enough that I could wear under t-shirts at all times, not only at the gym. For the support it provides, it also feels very, very comfortable, more so than many of my regular bras. I also love, love, love the form of the straps in the back - finally, I can wear one of those sexy sports tops without straps showing in all the wrong places! It was true to size, so no surprises there.For objectivity's sake, I must admit that it's not perfect: it goes on over your head (not the easiest way to put a bra on, and it's even more difficult to get it off), the nipples show (although I'd rather they show than have padding which adds another D to my cup!) and the band could be more snug. And I'm also a bit worried about durability.But all in all, for the support it provides at a very reasonable price, I'm delighted!

I like Tevas (Terra Fi 2) and have owned many pairs over the past 10 years. Love them for warm weather hiking, around the water, and general warm/wet conditions. But, I finally gave these Keens a try after wearing out the soles of my Tevas.The reviewers are right on. They feel like sneakers and I wear them all day with pleasure. These are a great buy. I'm going to buy another pair of Teva Terra Fi 2s also but I do love these Keens.Pros:- Rugged build- Great traction (I think the Tevas are a little better but I hardly notice the difference - that's the key detail)- I bought the mostly nylon (not leather) version (brown/bison) and they do dry quickly. My wife has the leather version and they're significantly slower to dry - overnight at least.- Extremely comfortable to wear all day- I never have to adjust these - they stay on my feet in all conditions with no worries- Look good with everything- There is a nice sense of comfort with that toe protector on the front- Wide toe bed - very niceCons if I have to name some (certainly won't deter me from buying these again):- In the sun, the toe bed/cap does get hot on your toes if you hang out in direct sun for a while- I agree with the other reviews (not necessarily on Amazon) that you'll read regarding the \"funk\". Yes, these do get funky/smelly very quickly - much more quickly than my Tevas ever did. But, hey, they're outdoor sandals. Throw them into the washing machine or go swimming with them every 3-4 days and you're set.The \"funk\" reputation worried me a little so I held off buying these but I can live with it. It's not as bad as I expected. And, these are super comfortable!Added after owning for six months:I think the Teva Terra Fi 2 probably have a slight edge when it comes to rafting/boating because they dry in record time and you can really tighten them so they don't shift on your foot. So, I'd give them a slightly higher score in terms of functionality for the very active or career outdoors folks.Also, I do get annoyed at the gravel that gets stuck in the toe bed of these - I can't shake it loose so I have to take them off and turn them upside down. This wasn't an issue with the Teva open toe design and I kind of miss those days. Last pet peeve: despite what my wife says, (she has same kind of Keens) the tread just isn't as good as the Teva's. Conclusion, I have to buy both for the forseeable future - they're both solid products and I won't give up either.Latest and Last Update: the sole gave out in less than a year - literally pieces/chunks fell off. I'm back to Tevas and happier with the much more reliable tread. The Tevas dry much much faster also. I think the Keens are really for wearing when you want to pretend you're doing something active outdoors - they were fine for just walking.2013 update: I bought what must be my 4th pair of Keens now. This pair is holding up much better than the last ones. So far, no problems at all with the sole. And, the stink/funk isn't a problem with these. There does seem to be a new kind of coating on the soles (inside) and so maybe that's helping. Anyway no issues so far and I'm a happy camper.", "asin": "B0001MQ60A"}, {"helpful": [0, 0], "overall": 3.0, "reviewerID": "A1BWKTFZVMK9LY", "summary": "cute", "reviewTime": "01 9, 2014", "unixReviewTime": 1389225600, "reviewerName": "Miranda", "reviewText": "Its not what I expected, looks like a jammy shirt, less like something you would wear out of the house!

But after a month or so, they were flattened out in places (especially the heel.) I don't like that. So I bought another pair...same thing. And while I loved the softness of those, I didn't want to spend every summer buying 2-3 pairs of the same things. And I found these.They look pretty much like the same shoe...but they are not. I liked that they both have a simple THIN strap, which shows off more of your foot and doesn't leave big \"tan lines\"! And they were soft. These are not as mushy as the Teva Mush, but firm-soft. Like you are walking on a mattress!!! Another nice thing over the Teva ones is that the surface is more solid/smooth. The Teva ones are more spongey...so sand gets in those holes and is HARD to get out. Which changes the color slightly. And that shows on a black pair. BUT there is a little trade-off, if your feet and shoes get wet (like at a waterpark or rain or something) these can be a little more slippery. It does improve after you wear them a while.This is the third year in a row that I have bought these. The old ones aren't worn out (like the flattened Tevas), but the color fades slightly and they do get wear. I wear mine ALL the time. I even wear them in the house when I am standing a long time! I do wear a half-size, and I chose a size UP. I don't like it when people's heels are hanging out over the end of the flip flops, so I erred on the bigger size. And they are fine. I was thrilled that they also come in more colors...I bought three pairs actually! The black ones on this page,metallic onesandsilver/gray/black ones. The metallic was for my daughter but she has wider feet than I do and she can't get the straps on comfortably. So, I guess they are mine. She CAN fit the same size Teva Mush, so she is getting those.

Generally I really like Carhartt and find their clothing to be well made and an excellent value. These socks were a disapointment on many levels. First and foremest they're surprisingly thin - as in paper thin.Compared to Champion Sport socks which usually sell at places like Marshalls for around $9 for a six pack these are I would venture to say 30% thinner. The lycra and spandex blend does little to help keep them up after the first wash. I found the gray \"thicker\" areas on the heel and toe to add some extra cushioning and the sewing - especially in the toe area makes for a more comfortable fit. But again, after one wash these benefits vanish.At this price you would expect these to surpass most anything you can grab off a shelf or out of a bin from most any big box store.

Unfortunately, they were painful, because pointy rocks pummeled my feet. So I figured that I'd give the Trail Glove a try, since it's actually made for running on trails, but as of this review, I'm still unsure (note that this is my initial review of the shoe and that I'll likely update it later.)The sole in the heel and the forefoot of the Trail Gloves may be a bit sturdier or more cushioned then with the Road Gloves, but the arch actually seems less sturdy and/or cushioned.  As of this point, I've only worn them around the yard and the heels and forefoot areas *may* be fine on rocky surfaces (I'm still not sure), but I worry about rocks poking through the arches. I guess you're supposed to step around rocky surfaces, so they don't poke in the arch area, but that's not possible on the trails where I run, so this has my very concerned. Other then that, I like them better then the Road Glove, although that may have something to do with the fit, which I'll expand on later.I also own a pair of Merrell Mix Master Trail Shoes and they're wonderful on trails. Unlike the Trail Glove, I believe they have a 0.4mm lift and the non-Vibram sole is more cushioned, which makes a big difference on rocks. If you want a great trail shoe, I have no hesitation in recommending the Mix Master from lot's of experience with the shoe. By the way, the Mix Master is supposed to be a hybrid of a barefoot/traditional running shoe, or an introduction to barefoot running, and I think it offers the best of both worlds.The thing I like about all these shoes is that they're light, airy and, most importantly, they handle getting wet well (i.e. they dry quickly and water doesn't ruin them.) I thrash mine, putting them through all sorts of abuse and they handle it very well. I'd actually been looking for shoes like these for many years before coming across these Merrell shoes, although other brands do make similar models today.Merrell is one of those brands of shoes where I struggle to find the best fit, because my normal size seems a bit big, but a half size smaller seems a little snug, so I normally stick with my normal size. When I purchased the Road Glove, I nearly went with a half size smaller, but the snugness had me worried enough to go with my normal size, instead. When I purchased the Trail Glove, I decided to give sizing down a chance and they fit perfect (remember that you're not going to wear socks with these shoes or I'd have gone with my normal size to compensate.) The Trail Glove may be slightly larger then the Road Glove, because they don't seem snug at all (in hindsight, I think sizing down with the Road Glove would have worked fine, also.) So, I'd recommend sizing down a half size, unless you have really big/wide feet or you plan on wearing socks for some reasons.Overall, these are very nice shoes, although I'm not a big fan of Vibram soles on barefoot shoes. The Vibram soles do offer a more barefoot feel and they're probably fine for running on soft surfaces, but I'm not sure that they have the cushion I need for rocky surfaces (they're great for wearing around the house, if you don't want to get your feet dirty, though.) However, I'm going to give them a try, in hope that they're better then the Road Glove on rocky surfaces, and I'll report back on what I find.", "asin": "B004L4B7HG"}, {"helpful": [0, 0], "overall": 5.0, "reviewerID": "A1U0SGKIDHQE1I", "summary": "Second pair", "reviewTime": "12 13, 2012", "unixReviewTime": 1355356800, "reviewerName": "Andrea", "reviewText": "Love these.

I'm guessing this is just variations in the sizing, but it something to keep in mind when buying them. You may buy a few pairs of the same jeans and find that the waist of each pair fits a little differently.The light stonewash pair is a nice Levi's color, not a 1980's stone wash. Just a lighter color of denim with white and blue color variations. It's subtle, something you would wear. Not something that looks like it came out of the attic from 25 years ago.The inspector color was my favorite. It's a great medium blue. Not dark by any means, but also not a light color. Inspector comes looking like the perfect shade of blue that will go with anything. Can be dressed up or working-in-the-garage casual.The Levi's 550 jeans are perfect if you're looking for regular basic jeans (not skinny jeans for guys, not boot cut for guys, etc). They're great for anyone who wants just basic fitting jeans, similar to the the straight leg style, but looser in the legs, which is perfect if buying the straight leg style is too tight in the legs for you.

They've been great for that purpose...even more comfortable than lightweight running/walking shoes that I paid over $100 for.  Besides the light weight, my favorite part of these shoes is the fact that they are a slip-on made of soft, stretchy fabric.  The tendons on the top of my foot in front of my ankle can become very painful when I increase my mileage too much or don't take a day off from exercising often enough.  With regular walking or running shoes, this spot is directly under where the shoelaces are tied and no matter how loosely I tie the laces, they really bother the sore tendons.  These Go Walk slip-ons are very soft and fortunately fall just a bit lower on the top of my foot.  Perfect.  They are SO extremely lightweight that I am a bit worried about how long they will hold up with daily use; so I'll update my review if they have an overly short lifespan. I've already put in an order for a couple more pair in other colors.  Other than those times when I need dressier shoes, I find myself reaching for these shoes for every other outing.UPDATE:  Well, a few weeks later, and I'm still really liking the shoes.  There is one issue that I've noticed with them, though.  The soles are very soft and the tread is made up of varying size protruding circles.  Because of this, lots of small pea-sized pebbles get lodged in the tread.

It's just too hot in the summer to wear traditional boots (at least for me). The Sloggers garden shoes are very comfortable around the house and they are indeed waterproof - that alone makes them a worthwhile purchase. They have a really cushy lining inside. I also like the tread on the bottom of the sole - solid enough to walk in mud and slippery ground without sliding around at all.The ONLY complaint I have and the reason I am leaving a four star rather than five star review is the heel & overall fit. I wear an 8 1/2 normally in sneakers and boots and 9 in high heels, so I ordered the size 9. I figured even if they were a tad wider than needed, socks would make up for the difference. They fit fine with regard to actual measurements. However, with every step the heel is very loose and feels like it's going to slide off my foot. They feel like those backless clogs instead of a solid fitting shoe. The height of the back of the shoe is lower than a traditional shoe and higher than a traditional clog. DROVE ME CRAZY for the first few days and now I've gotten used to it & it's fine. Just a warning though if you need the support of a regular back or heel, then these probably aren't for you.************************UPDATE Oct 2011*********************************************After wearing these Sloggers every single day since I bought them I am still very happy with them. They are indeed waterproof - I stepped in what turned out to be a deep puddle, immersing the shoes to the very top edge. No damage whatsoever inside or out. My foot was dry inside the shoe. I was concerned that every day use would stretch them at the ankle area or it would weaken etc - so far it's just like new.

He is more or less average build, with maybe slightly thicker thighs, not an overly thin or heavy kid. When he tried on these 511s however, he couldn't button them. Close...but just too small. (I was going to return them but of course he ripped all the tags off and threw them on the floor for 3 days...so I didn't.)

In contrast, Levi's jeans are cool and timeless, like the Rolling Stones and ZZ Top. They work for men whether urban or country.

But I needed an all in one shaper in a light weight  and in a skin tone for under a dress. The rosewood color is really a light nude. I chose this one, with a built in bra since it  came in the 36DD I need, where most just have a one size fits all top that smashes my top into a huge uni-boob. I am average size, but large busted and have a few recently acquired mid-section rolls. I hoped to smooth out the rolls, even that unsightly though small one just under my breast line that looks like I am growing a second set, it is hard to find a bra that comes down low enough to cover that one, or underwear/hosiery high enough to meet a bra to cover it up. I also hope to maybe minimize the \"girls\" a bit in the process. Also, I did not want any padding in the bra portion, as my dress has a touch of padding there for modesty, and I already have enough padding naturally! This briefer met ALL of my requirements perfectly and made me look two sizes smaller! I chose this lace briefer due to it being lightweight and breathable for the upcoming summer.  I was very pleasantly surprised with this great piece and good price! The stretch lace feels light and airy, and is soft, not itchy. The bra portion has adjustable straps of good sizes that did not dig into the shoulders, and I could not even feel the underwires at all - although they were obviously working since I was well supported and perky. The stretch lace of the bra portion also smoothed, separated, and did not smash my breasts though did seem to minimize a bit. Also, the briefer shaped me smoothly without digging in or strangling any part of my body - and the one piece construction did not allow for any bulges to pop out anywhere keeping all \"rolls\" in check for the hour I tried it on under my dress and also tried it on under other wardrobe items.  I now understand why the ladies of the mid-century in old photos always looked \"smooth\", even matronly women did not have bulges and rolls showing. It is because they used to wear girdles with attached bras - all in one piece. The idea is back, with more comfortable options like this one. I think I could get used to this being a regular addition to my wardrobe! I look smaller wearing this underneath everything!  Hopefully the briefer will retain it's shape, as well as mine, and I will be back in June to give an updated review!Update after one month: I have started wearing this as a day to day item under clothes to work and am very happy with it, in fact I ordered more so I have a supply for regular wear.

The fleece is a 5 star and I will comment on that later.BAD REVIEW ON TUSK: I previously ordered the Charcoal Heather Columbia fleece and LOVED IT, so I decided to order the tusk fleece, considering the picture on Amazon showed it was WHITE. I received the fleece in one business day which was a nice benefit of prime. I was very excited to have a white one, but was I disappointed when I opened up the box. The tusk color, is more like an elephant grey mixed with khaki (or an elephant that rulled in mud and it dried) color, which does make sense of why they would call it Tusk. I then looked on Columbia's website, and their tusk really is greyish/tan and not white. I have no idea why they would put a white picture up when it really isn't. It isn't a bad color, just not what I wanted. If you want to know what the tusk color looks like google it first, or look at the amazon picture of the tusk/grill fleece.GOOD REVIEW ON COLUMBIA FLEECE: The previous Charcoal Heather fleece and the Black fleece I ordered are both absolutely amazing. The fleeces are soft, comfy and true to size. Definitely very happy with it, and will be ordering probably different colors. Wish they did have it in white. But other than the wrong picture labeling, I am very pleased with the fleece itself and the other colors.", "asin": "B0076R6KY0"}, {"helpful": [0, 0], "overall": 5.0, "reviewerID": "AEMBPMLIHEWH7", "summary": "so cute", "reviewTime": "03 20, 2013", "unixReviewTime": 1363737600, "reviewerName": "Jennifer Hardie", "reviewText": "love bearpaw boots.. great price, great quality, comfy and super cute.

Sherwin", "reviewText": "Kenneth Cole makes a wonderful \"Reaction Men's Waldorf 1 3/8\" Reversible Leather Belt;\" and once you buy this and wear it you'll be amazed that you ever did without it! The leather belt is very well made; you can tell just by the feel of it. It has an attractive buckle that nevertheless doesn't detract from what you're wearing. Great!The belt has several different holes so that you can adjust it if you gain or lose a few pounds; this is very good and of course it's a standard feature on most belts for both men. However, this belt has one huge advantage--it's reversible! You can just easily turn it around at the base of the buckle and switch from a black belt to a brown belt or vice versa. That's excellent and it makes this belt a good value for your money.Taking care of the belt is easy. I recommend hanging it by its buckle on top of a suit hanger or any hanger that has clothing on it that is long enough not to reach the floor. If it hangs high enough so as not to reach the floor, the belt will stay relatively \"straight\" without any slight bending which the leather may do over time if you just leave the end of it curled up on the floor on a hanger that hangs just too low.In addition, this is a leather belt; if you want to clean or make the leather look its best in any way just carefully follow the directions on the label of any leather cleaner. I would, however, apply a bit of the substance to a part of the belt that's not going to be noticeable just in case the cleanser or buffer backfires and makes a small stain that you don't want people to see.If you do choose to buy the belt through this website, you may want to use the charts above to help you pick your size.Overall, Kenneth Cole gets two thumbs up from me for this excellent belt!

I'm a 38D, and I have an issue with most bras, usually with my boobs falling out of the cup, but mostly with \"uni-boobage\".  Every bra I wear makes my boobs gravitate toward each other after just a few minutes.  Not cool.  I constantly find myself with my hands in my shirt adjusting myself.  Plus, I HATE underwire.  So I thought I would give this bra a try based on all the awesome reviews.Upon receiving, I couldn't wait to try it on.  But after not even 10 minutes of wearing it, I can't wait to rip it off.  It is on me as we speak.  It is the ITCHIEST bra I have EVER worn.  I don't know why either.  I have never worn a bra that made me itch SO much.  It itches EVERYWHERE... in the cups, in the front, but mostly in the back.  I also feel the material in the sides of the back of the bra stabbing me.  I'm not allergic to ANY fabric either, so that isn't it.  This really sucks, because it's doing a great job of keeping my boobs separated, like all bras SHOULD do, but don't.  The straps are NOT uncomfortable at all (for me anyway) like some of the other reviewers stated.  But damn, it is ITCHYYYYY!!  Also, you can see your nips through your t-shirt if the wind picks up, lol.  Very thin cup lining.I don't know yet if I will return it or get used to the itching because it does exactly what I have been searching for for YEARS, which is keep my boobs where they are supposed to be.  I can do backflips and cartwheels and they stay in the cups.  I just wish it was made of cotton or something softer to the skin.2/13/13******** Update!  The bra is NOT AS itchy after the 2nd day of wearing it.  I don't know if I got used to the itch or what.  It's still itchy, but not AS BAD as day 1.  Gives me great support and my chest fills the cups perfectly.2/14/13******** Update!  The bra doesn't itch me at all today, after the 3rd day.  So weird, I just can't understand it.

The very well done double elastic ribbing works well to keep these socks up while at the same time not being too tight on your lower leg. The sock itself comes in white; but the toe area and the heel area are literally made from grey colored fibers to give the sock a better \"look.\"I would not dry these socks at high temperatures.

The 511s looked like they would rectify this problem, and they do. Except they can be rather tight at the ankle which makes it more snug if you have big feet like me (Size US 12) and are trying to slip them through.The Midnight Oil color was hard to discern online, but in real life they are a very very very dark blue that is almost black. I liked this color because it came with a black leather patch at the back and dark grey stitching. The sizing is spot on, I always buy 1 or 2 sizes larger than my actual waist measurement because this gives me comfort room in the butt and groin area which is important for men.Overall: 5/5 stars.

The thigh is not overly binding (but I'm not a pear-shape, I'm more avocado/appley with belly fat being an issue). The waist is comfortable.

It's a little bit depressing to look down and see the equivalent of a 13 year old boy. At least there is no bouncing.", "asin": "B001AOZVSQ"}, {"helpful": [0, 0], "overall": 2.0, "reviewerID": "A2OMZ8QPFZQBO4", "summary": "Umm not comfortable..", "reviewTime": "04 13, 2012", "unixReviewTime": 1334275200, "reviewerName": "Megami", "reviewText": "I'm size 7 and this feels like size 6.5. The front tho..seemed right length but the back seems a bit short, and the straps were too tight. Not sure if the straps would be comfortable even if it wasn't tight tho... The sole padding feels just ok but the material they use should be questioned... I dont think its comfortable on the skin at all. And its true the bottom can be slippery coz it's pretty much flat. I don't think it's worth the money. If it was $13 bux I would get an exchange for a bigger size.My questions is why the hell do these companies make sandals that are uncomfortable and charge us what it's to worth??? That is plain stupid. It is OBVIOUS they didnt use a shoe model... Thank god for amazon tho I can just get a refund hassle free.", "asin": "B000AI3BUS"}, {"helpful": [0, 0], "overall": 5.0, "reviewerID": "AVUJP7Z6BNT11", "summary": "This is awesome", "reviewTime": "03 10, 2014", "unixReviewTime": 1394409600, "reviewerName": "CB", "reviewText": "Beautiful and unique necklace for an owl lover or someone wanting a more lived in looking necklace.
